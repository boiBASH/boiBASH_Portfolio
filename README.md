OVERVIEW

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation.

The NHANES program began in the early 1960s and has been conducted as a series of surveys focusing on different population groups or health topics. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.

The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.

To date, thousands of research findings have been published using the NHANES data.

# [PROJECT 4: Figuring Our Which Customers May Leave - Churn Analysis](https://github.com/boiBASH/MY-PROJECTS/blob/main/Figuring_Our_Which_Customers_May_Leave_Churn.ipynb)
* We have customer information for a Telecommunications company
* We've got customer IDs, general customer info, the servies they've subscribed too, type of contract and monthly charges.
* This is a historic customer information so we have a field stating whether that customer has churnded Field Descriptions


# [PROJECT 5: Movie Recommendation System using Deep Learning](https://github.com/boiBASH/MY-PROJECTS/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Recommendation_Engine.ipynb)
Based on the structured data extracted, we'll train a network that learns to predict a movie based on the outgoing links on the corresponding Wikipedia page. This creates embeddings for the movies. This in turn lets us recommend movies based on other movies - similar movies are next to each other in the embedding space.
